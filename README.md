# JavaScript Playground 🚀

This repository is my personal front-end lab — a growing collection of small, focused JavaScript projects where I convert ideas into functional UI components using **Vanilla JS, HTML & CSS**.

The goal is simple: **Practice like a real engineer — build small, build often, learn continuously.**

Every project lives in its own folder (ex: Counter App, Theme Switcher, Digital Clock, Random Color Generator etc.) and each one focuses on one core concept such as DOM manipulation, events, state handling, UX feedback, async behaviour or browser APIs.

This repo demonstrates:
- practical JavaScript problem solving
- clean code, readable structure
- modular thinking (each project independent)
- UI behaviour driven by logic — not just styling

New projects will be continuously added, evolving in complexity — from beginner interactions → to advanced front-end components.

> **This is not just a repo — this is my hands-on JavaScript growth journey.**
>
> Real code. Real practice. Real improvement.
